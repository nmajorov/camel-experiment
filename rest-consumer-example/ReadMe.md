Camel Router  for Apache CXF  Blueprint (OSGi)
=========================================================================


This example shows how to create a camel route which read a file and send it to the Restful service endpoint.

            ```xml

            <route id="cxf">
            <from uri="file:work/inc/input"/>
            <log message="Receiving incident ${file:name}"/>
            <to uri="cxfrs://bean://rsClient?provider=#myProvider"/>
            </route>

            ```
The custom file to xml restful provider has to be defined in the blueprint configuration.


To build this project use

    mvn install

To deploy the project in OSGi. For example using Apache ServiceMix
or Apache Karaf. You need to install the following features first:

    features:install camel-jaxb
    features:install camel-cxf

You don't need to do this step for JBoss Fuse 6.x


And then you can install this example from its shell:

    osgi:install -s mvn:biz.majorov.camel/rest-consumer-example/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

The web services from Apache CXF is usually listed at:

    http://localhost:8181/cxf

And the WADL file for this example at:

   http://localhost:8181/cxf/inc/?_wadl




To test rest service with curl:


Send incident with command:

      curl -v -X POST -T <path>/rest-consumer-example/src/test/resources/incident.xml   http://localhost:8181/cxf/inc/incidents/report -H "Content-Type: text/xml"


Get incident with command:

      curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8181/cxf/inc/incidents/incident/637807
